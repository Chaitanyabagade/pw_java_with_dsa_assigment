1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans: They aJe used when a condition compJises moJe than one boolean expJession. FoJ instance/ if we want to
pJint a numbeJ only if it is gJeateJ than 2 and less than 5/ then we will use conditional opeJatoJs to combine the
2 expJessions. We have 3 types of conditional opeJatoJs - logical-and/ logical-oJ and teJnaJy opeJatoJ.
Logical-and operator (&&)
It is used when we want the condition to be tJue iff both the expJessions aJe tJue.
Syntax

Logical-or operator (||)
This opeJatoJ is used when we aJe satisfied as long as any one of the boolean expJessions is evaluated as tJue.
Syntax

Ternary operator (?:)
It is a smalleJ veJsion foJ the if-else statement. If the condition is tJue then the statement - 1 is executed else the
statement - 2 is executed.
Syntax
condition ? statement - 1  statement - 2;
2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: TheJe aJe thJee types of opeJatoJs in java based on the numbeJ of opeJands. They aJe
. UnaJy opeJatoI
. BinaJy opeJatoI
. TeJnaJy opeJatoI
.
3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
Ans: Switch statement
The switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks foJ execution.
Break keyword: As java Jeaches a bJeak keywoJd/ the contJol bJeaks out of the switch block. The execution of
code stops on encounteJing this keywoJd/ and the case testing inside the block ends as the match is found. A
lot of execution time can be saved because it ignoJes the Jest of the code's execution when theJe is a bJeak.
Default keywoJd The keywoJd is used to specify the code executed when the expJession does not match any
test case.
The switch case in Java woJks like an if-else laddeJ/ i.e./ multiple conditions can be checked at once. Switch is
pJovided with an expJession that can be a constant oJ liteJal expJession that can be evaluated. The value of the
expJession is matched with each test case till a match is found. If theJe is no match/ the default keywoJd/ if
specified- the associated code executes. OtheJwise/ the code specified foJ the matched test case is executed.
if(condition - 1 && condition - 2) {
statement;
}

if(condition - 1 || condition - 2) {
statement;
}
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int month = 4;
switch (month) {
case 1:
System.out.println("January");
break;
case 2:
System.out.println("February");
break;
case 3:
System.out.println("March");
break;
case 4:
System.out.println("April");
break;
case 5:
System.out.println("May");
break;
case 6:
System.out.println("June");
break;
default: System.out.println("In next half");
}
}
}
Output: April

6. What is the syntax of if else statement?

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
3 typ:s of it:rativ: stat:3:nts in jav2
T for loo9
T whil: loo9
T do-whil: loop
8. Difference Uetween for loop and do while loop
9. Write a program to print numUers from 1 to 10.
if (condition1) {
// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
// block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
